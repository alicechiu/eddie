                <h2>Three Pillars of Photography</h2>
                   <h4>ISO</h4>
                      <p>ISO measures the sensitivity of the image sensor. Put simply, it will brighten or darken an image. The higher the number is set, it means the sensor
                         becomes more sensitive to light which allows you to use the camera in darker situations. The downside
                         to this is that there will be more noise in the image. Different cameras will have different settings for the ISO. An an example, some may come 
                         with lower number such as ISO 100 and higher ones like ISO 6400. Ideally, it is best to always try to use the lowest native base ISO so that
                         it gives the highest image quality. However, that may not be the case under low-light conditions.
                      </p>
                    <h4>Aperture</h4>
                      <p>Aperture is the opening in a lens to allow light to enter into the camera. Similarly, think about how your eyes work.
                         As you move between brighter or darker environments, the iris in the eyes either shrinks or expands, controlling the pupil size. So in photography, 
                         the "pupil" of your lens is the aperture. You can make the aperture smaller or bigger to allow light into the camera sensor.</p>
                    <h4>Shutter Speed</h4>
                      <p>Shutter speed is the length of time camera shutter is open, exposing light on the camera sensor. Depending on how long the 
                          camera spends on taking the photo, it has a few effects in how the images will be produced. 
                    
                          When long shutter speed is used, you end up exposing your sensor for a significant period of time. The first big effect of it is motion blur.
                          If your shutter speed is long, moving subjects in your photo will appear blurred along the direction of motion.
                        
                          Slow shutter speeds are also used to photograph the Milky Way or other objects at night, or in dim environments with a tripod. Landscape photographers
                          may intentionally use long shutter speeds to create a sense of motion on rivers and waterfalls, while keeping everything else completely sharp.
                      </p>

                <h2>Mirrorless vs DSLR</h2>
                      <p>DSLR uses the same design as the 35mm film cameras from the past. A mirror inside the camera body reflects the light coming in through the lens up to a prism, 
                          and into the viewfinder for you to preview your shot. When you press the shutter button, the mirror flips up, a shutter opens and the light falls onto the image sensor, 
                          which captures the final image. In a mirrorless camera, light passes through the lens and right onto the image sensor, which captures a preview of the image to display on the rear screen. 
                          Some models also offer a second screen inside an electronic viewfinder that you can put your eye up to.  </p>

                <h2>Which lens should I buy?</h2>
                        <p>It depends on your needs and what you want to shoot. Examples like architecture, portraits, landscape, wedding, etc...</p>
                            <li>Fisheye (Cityscapes, landscape, real estate)</li>
                            <li>Wide angle (Landscapes, architecture, interiors)</li>
                            <li>Standard (Street, casual, portraits)</li>
                            <li>Telephoto (Sports, wildlife, astrophotography)</li>
